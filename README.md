# CPP-Clock
A CLI clock program written in C++

This project displays a clock in 12-hour and 24-hour time simultaneously while also allowing the user to update the time by the hour, minute, and second. I believe what I did particularly well was making sure both clocks update correctly. I could definitely enhance the code to make the structure around the clocks not dependent on so many for loops. Skills from this project that were transferable to other projects from my course work include certain functions such as the clear screen function and the one that handles user input. I helped in the code's maintainability, readability, and adaptability through the use of separating these different functions to make the main function as simple as possible and through the use of comments noting what each section of the code does.

To run this program, clone into this repository and then run the solution in Visual Studio.
